## Project Overview

This project is a faithful recreation of the original Super Mario Bros World 1-1 with updated features and behaviors. It focuses on the following enhancements:
  
- **Enhanced Enemy Interactions:** Detailed collision handling between Mario, Goombas, Koopas, and other enemies.
- **Power-Up Dynamics:** Blocks spawn different items such as mushrooms, fire flowers, and 1-Ups based on Mario’s state.
- **Retro Visual Style:** The game uses classic pixel art styling methods that mimic NES aesthetics.
- **Responsive Controls and Physics:** Realistic gravity, jumping physics, and collision resolution, integrated into a modern web application.

The gameplay is implemented through a dedicated game canvas component, where key events and animations create a smooth, responsive experience.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Gameplay and Mechanics

The game simulates classic platformer behavior:

- **Character Movement:** Mario can run, jump, and interact with various objects. The physics include gravity, inertia, and collision detection.
- **Enemy Behavior:** Goombas patrol platforms with simple AI that reverses direction at level borders or when colliding with solid objects.
- **Collision and Interactions:** 
  - When colliding with enemies, Mario can stomp from above to defeat them.
  - Mario’s state changes (small, big, fire) affect the outcome of collisions.
  - Blocks change state upon interaction, spawning power-ups or coins.
- **Power-Ups and Items:**
  - **Mushroom:** Transforms Mario from small to big.
  - **Fire Flower:** Grants Mario temporary fire abilities.
  - **Coin:** Collectible to increase score and progress toward extra lives.
  - **1-Up:** Awards an extra life when collected.
- **Audio Feedback:** Actions like jumping, stomping, collecting coins, and power-ups trigger sound effects generated using a custom audio context.
  
Animations and physics update continuously on the game canvas to provide an immersive player experience.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (or your preferred package manager such as yarn or bun)

Follow these steps to install the dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/holynakamoto/goomba-mushroom-world.git
   cd goomba-mushroom-world
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or with yarn:
   ```bash

   ```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Running the Game

After installation, you can launch the game with the following commands:

- **Start the Development Server:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will start a local development server, typically available at `http://localhost:3000` or the port specified by Vite.

- **Build for Production:**

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the main project directories and files:

| Directory/File                | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| **index.html**                | Contains the base HTML markup and links to the bundled script. |
| **package.json**              | Defines project metadata and scripts. |
| **src/main.tsx**              | Entry point that renders the React application into the root element. |
| **src/App.tsx**               | Sets up the routing and essential providers using React Query, Tooltip, and Toaster. |
| **src/pages/Index.tsx**       | The main game view that embeds the GameCanvas component along with the title and introduction. |
| **src/pages/NotFound.tsx**    | Renders a fallback view for undefined routes. |
| **src/components/GameCanvas.tsx** | Contains the core game logic including canvas rendering, event handling, and physics. |
| **src/lib/utils.ts**          | Utility functions (e.g., class name merging) used throughout the project. |
| **tailwind.config.ts**        | Tailwind CSS configuration file. |
| **eslint.config.js**          | ESLint configuration for maintaining code quality and standards. |

------------------------------------------------------------
## Technologies Used

- **React & TypeScript:** For building the UI and managing component-based state.
- **Vite:** Provides fast bundling and a modern development server.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and rapid UI development.
- **ESLint:** Enforces code quality and consistency.
- **React Router:** Manages the client-side routing for different pages.
- **React Query:** Facilitates asynchronous data fetching and caching.
- **Audio Context API:** Generates game sounds for dynamic events.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Configuration

- **ESLint:** The ESLint configuration is defined in the `eslint.config.js` file and includes support for React Hooks and TypeScript rules.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The styling is managed by Tailwind CSS with a configuration file (`tailwind.config.ts`) and entry CSS in `src/index.css`.
- **Bundler Settings:** The project uses Vite for development and production builds.
